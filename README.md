Hello
As a university student who has always struggled with finding the right task manager app to help improve productivity, I decided to create a solution that would meet my needs while helping other students, too.

Before starting this project, I had no experience in frontend and design, and this project helped me apply my knowledge after learning and practising from online courses.
I have experience with backend development due to my coursework and internship, and this project will further extend my knowledge of developing a robust backend system.

# Problem
Current task management apps are too complicated. They have many unnecessary features for businesses, making them hard for regular people to use for their daily tasks.
Most task apps only focus on things you need to do today. But people often work on more significant projects and studies that take longer. Users need a way to manage tasks that last multiple days and easily track their progress over time.

Evidence of users having such [Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gu3ovu/why_do_task_management_apps_feel_like_theyre/)

Current apps also have other problems: they don't help users prioritize tasks well, don't allow for breaking down tasks into smaller steps, and don't show clear visual warnings about urgent tasks. This makes it hard for people to stay organized.

# Purpose

To create a clean, user-friendly to-do app that simplifies task management by enabling users to:
•	Break down larger tasks into manageable subtasks.
•	Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and progress.
•	Organize daily subtasks and easily roll over unfinished tasks.
This app will help users manage their time effectively, reduce stress, and achieve consistent progress without feeling overwhelmed.

# Target Market

The key audience is students who want to simplify task management to ensure that they are on track with their tasks while juggling multiple subjects each with its own set of assignments, exams and other assessments.

# Features

Key Features needed to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Creating a Main Task with multiple Sub Tasks in a drop-down/ collapsible side menu
- Adding Sub Tasks using drag and drop functionality into the main viewing area for the current day

Extra/ Future Features

- Calendar View of Tasks
- Reminders/ Alerts a few days before the due date
- Visual Cues, i.e. tasks turning from red to green
- Automatically Assign unfinished tasks to the next day
- Prioritisation System.

# Design
<img width="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1edd8684-bc3c-4209-a03c-4888dc05bd36" />

In this design users can create unplanned tasks within the sidebar which then can be added to the main focus of the current days tasks.
