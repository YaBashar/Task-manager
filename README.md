Hi This is a project I’ve been working on and documenting the journey from start to finish. 

As a university student who has always struggled with finding the right task manager app to help improve productivity, I decided to create my own solution that would meet my needs while hopefully helping other students too.

Before starting this project I had no experience in frontend and design and this project helped me apply my knowledge after learning and practicing from online courses.

I have experience with backend development due to my coursework and internship and I hope this project will further extend my knowledge of developing a robust backend system.

# Problem Statement

Current task management apps are too complicated. They have many unnecessary features meant for businesses, which makes them hard for regular people to use for their daily tasks.

Most task apps only focus on things you need to do today. But people often work on bigger projects and studies that take longer to complete. Users need a way to manage tasks that last multiple days and easily track their progress over time.

Evidence of users having such [Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gu3ovu/why_do_task_management_apps_feel_like_theyre/)

Current apps also have other problems: they don't help users prioritize tasks well, don't allow for breaking down tasks into smaller steps, and don't show clear visual warnings about urgent tasks. This makes it hard for people to stay organized.

# Purpose

To create a clean, user-friendly to-do app that simplifies task management by enabling users to:
•	Break down larger tasks into manageable subtasks.
•	Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and progress.
•	Organize daily subtasks and easily rollover unfinished tasks.
This app will help users manage their time effectively, reduce stress, and achieve consistent progress without feeling overwhelmed.

# Target Market

The key audience is for students to simplify task management to ensure that they are on track of education while juggling multiple subjects with each having its own set of assignments exams and other assessments.

# Features

Key Features needed to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Creating Main Task with multiple Sub Tasks in a drop down/ collapsible side menu
- Adding Sub Tasks using drag and drop functionality into main viewing area for current day

Extra/ Future Features

- Calendar View of Tasks
- Reminders/ Alerts few days before due date
- Visual Cues ie tasks turning from red to green
- Automatically Assign unfinished tasks to next day
- Prioritisation System.

# Design

In this design users can create unplanned tasks within the sidebar which then can be added to the main focus of the current days tasks.
